== Overview

You can access ENV variables as flattened % surrounded variables in these templated asciddoc files.

=== variables from ENV as asciidoc attributes

NOTE: json objects are flattned and joined with a `.`.
As a side-effect of the `.`, any character will match the `.` in the variable name.

.Example: All of these function
----
:my_deep_var_underbars: %my_deep_var%
:my_deep_var_dots: %my.deep.var%

my_deep_var_underbars: {my_deep_var_underbars}
my_deep_var_dots: {my_deep_var_dots}

my_deep_var_underbars: %my_deep_var%
my_deep_var_dots: %my.deep.var%
